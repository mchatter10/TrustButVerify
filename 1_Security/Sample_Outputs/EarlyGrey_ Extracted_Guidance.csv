Security Feature,Guidance,
Internal Clock Configuration,"Use the internally generated configuration clock to resist clock glitching attacks. This internal clock is not accessible or modifiable by an adversary with physical access, providing an added layer of protection during the configuration process. Though it may be slower and have wider duty cycle margins than external clocks, it is a recommended security enhancement.",
Side Channel Attack Protection,"Choose FPGA families that include side-channel attack (SCA) resistant cryptographic engines, and consider the number of ""traces"" required to recover a key as a security strength metric. Use key rolling to limit the exposure of any single key by encrypting bitstream blocks with different keys. Side-channel protection adds power and timing overhead, but is vital if adversaries may monitor power or EM emissions.",
Secure Boot,"Use FPGAs with immutable boot code stored in non-writable memory (e.g., ROM). Ensure the first-stage boot loader (FSBL) is encrypted and authenticated before use. The boot process should begin with authentication, then decryption. Prioritize authentication over encryption. Devices should support boot process version control to prevent replay attacks.",
Encryption Algorithms,"Use AES-256 encryption with CTR or GCM mode for configuration files. Avoid relying on bitstream complexity for protection. Ensure encryption implementations are NIST CAVP validated. Authentication must precede decryption. Use key-wrapping with an equal or greater key strength (e.g., AES-256) to secure secret keys. Key management (generation, storage, revocation) must be robust and well-planned.",
FPGA Device Type Selection,"Flash-based FPGAs are recommended for storing configuration data internally, reducing exposure. Antifuse FPGAs are secure and immutable but not reprogrammable. SRAM-based FPGAs have high performance and capacity but require external memory and are more vulnerable to radiation and boot-time attacks. Device selection should balance performance, environment, and security needs.",
