Security Feature ,Present in Design ,Evidence from [DOC1] 
Internal Clock Configuration ,Yes ,"The design uses multiple internally distributed clocks from the ast module, including sys, io, usb, and aon, which are divided and managed internally through a clock manager (clkmgr). This aligns with the guidance to avoid external clocks for security-critical functions. "
Side Channel Attack Protection ,Partially ,"While AES and HMAC modules are present, and entropy is distributed via EDN and CSRNG, there is no explicit mention of side-channel protection techniques like key rolling or SCA-resistant hardware engines. Thus, some cryptographic protections exist, but SCA resistance is not clearly indicated. "
Secure Boot ,Yes ,"A secure boot process is implemented with ROM validation of embedded flash code using RSA signature checks. The ROM will shut down the device if the flash code is invalid, aligning well with the secure boot guidance including immutable boot code and boot stage authentication. "
Encryption Algorithms ,Yes ,"The design supports AES with key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, and CTR mode is available. It also supports SHA-256 and HMAC. Although GCM is not implemented in hardware, it can be constructed. This aligns with recommendations from [DOC0] on using strong encryption with authenticated boot sequences. "
FPGA Device Type Selection ,Partially ,"The design targets the CW310 FPGA board, implying use of an SRAM-based FPGA. SRAM-based FPGAs are less secure than flash or antifuse types due to external configuration dependencies. The document discusses modeling non-volatile flash in FPGA but does not improve intrinsic FPGA type security. "
