      "This document provides detailed specifications and design considerations for an implementation of a masked AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher core. The mask is applied to protect against side-channel attacks, including power analysis and timing attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Masking Scheme**\n",
      "\n",
      "The masking scheme employed in this implementation is 1st-order masking, which means that both the cipher and key expand data paths use two shares. This provides protection against first-order side-channel attacks, such as power analysis and timing attacks.\n",

      "**Data Path Architecture**\n",
      "\n",
      "The AES unit uses a parallel data path to increase noise in the system and make it more resistant to higher-order side-channel attacks. The 128-bit parallel data path uses up to 20 S-Boxes (16 inside SubBytes, 4 inside KeyExpand) that are evaluated in parallel.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Sparse Encodings of FSM States**: All FSMs inside the AES unit use sparse state encodings.\n",
      "*   **Sparse Encodings for Mux Selector Signals**: All main muxes use sparsely encoded selector signals.\n",
      "*   **Sparse Encodings for Handshake and Other Important Control Signals**:\n",
      "    *   Sparse encodings are used for handshake signals to reduce the Hamming weight of the signal.\n",
      "    *   The number of logic rails can be scaled up by means of relatively easy RTL modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fault Injection Countermeasures**\n",
      "\n",
      "If any countermeasure detects a fault, a fatal alert is triggered, the internal FSMs go into a terminal error state, and the AES unit does not release further data. A system-supplied reset is required before the AES unit can become operational again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The implementation also includes measures to protect against key leakage during reset:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clearing Registers with Pseudo-Random Data**: All major key and data registers are cleared with pseudo-random data upon reset.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "| Countermeasure | Description |\n",
      "| :------------ | :---------- |\n",

      "Overall, this implementation provides a robust and secure design for the masked AES cipher core. The use of 1st-order masking, parallel data paths, sparse encodings, shadowed control registers, and pseudo-random data reset measures make it resistant to various side-channel attacks and fault injection attacks.\n",
