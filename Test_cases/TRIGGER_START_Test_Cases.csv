TC_START_ 01,Normal Trigger Start (Manual Mode),Verify correct behavior when TRIGGER.START is issued with CTRL_SHADOWED.MANUAL_ OPERATION = 1,1.Set CTRL_SHADOWED.MANUAL_ OPERATION to 1.,"AES unit begins encryption/ decryption. STATUS.IDLE clears to 0 (busy). After block completes, STATUS.OUTPUT_ VALID is set to 1"
,,,"2.Provide valid key, IV, and input data.",
,,,3.Assert TRIGGER.START,
TC_START_ 02,Trigger Ignored (Automatic Mode),Verify that TRIGGER.START is ignored when not in manual mode (CTRL_ SHADOWED.MANUAL_ OPERATION = 0 ).,1.Set CTRL_ SHADOWED.MANUAL_ OPERATION to 0.,TRIGGER.START has no effect; AES unit only starts when all inputs are ready. STATUS.IDLE remains unchanged.
,,,2.Assert TRIGGER.START,
TC_START_ 03,Premature Trigger While Busy,Ensure TRIGGER.START is ignored if AES unit is busy (STATUS.IDLE = 0 ).,1.Trigger an AES operation and assert TRIGGER.START .,Second TRIGGER.START is ignored. Operation continues from first trigger. STATUS.IDLE remains 0 until operation completes.
,,,"2.Before completion, reassert TRIGGER.START",
TC_START_04,Output Overwrite Check,Validate behavior when new trigger is issued before output is read (with MANUAL_OPERATION = 1 ).,1. Start encryption.2. Do not read output data.3. Reassert TRIGGER.START for new data block,Output registers are overwritten. STATUS.OUTPUT_LOST is set to 1 after an overwrite of unread output occurs 
TC_START_05,Missing Inputs Prevent Start,Test that AES doesn't start if not all inputs are written (in automatic mode).,1. Set MANUAL_OPERATION = 0. 2. Write only partial input data or IV. 3. Observe AES behavior.,AES unit does not start; STATUS.IDLE remains 1. Only starts once all required registers are fully written.
TC_START_06,Reset Effect on TRIGGER.START,Check that a system reset clears TRIGGER.START effect.,1. Assert TRIGGER.START . 2. Immediately issue a system reset.,AES unit resets internal state. Any pending trigger is canceled.
TC_START_07,Key Change Reseed Trigger,Ensure internal PRNG reseeds on key change and TRIGGER.START follows.,1. Write a new key with CTRL_AUX_SHADOWED.KEY_TOUCH_FORCES_RESEED = 1 .2. Assert TRIGGER.START.,PRNG is reseeded. AES operation begins after reseed. STATUS.IDLE = 0 during processing.
TC_START_08,Trigger with AES_NONE Mode,Ensure TRIGGER.START has no effect if MODE = AES_NONE,1. Set CTRL_SHADOWED.MODE = AES_NONE. 2. Assert TRIGGER.START,AES unit remains idle. No encryption/decryption occurs. STATUS.IDLE = 1
